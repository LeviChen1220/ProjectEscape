## About
ProjectEscape is a third-person shooter **research project** developed using Unreal Engine 5.5. This project is designed as a prototype to explore and experiment with key gameplay systems typical of shooter games. 
The main focus areas include character movement, aiming and shooting mechanics, ammunition handling, and multiplayer replication. It also serves as a testing ground for integrating the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) and fine-tuning networked gameplay.
